# The Tic Tack Toe Game (From the Create React App)

This project was created follwing the React tutorial to create a tic tack toe 9 squares game: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.htm 

has history of moves.  

This is a work in progress, but I'd like to implement better styling for the board squares to animate the drawing of the hash like we did when we were children.  In terms of logic features, I think it might be cool if we could give hints for the moves.  First in the Roadmap of Future Improvements, when someone wins, we can highlight the three squares that caused the win.  that seems pretty straight forward since we already have the "win" array, but then if we could provide "hints" to the player as to her options by flashing potential and advantageous moves after the 4th turn, that would make it, well potentially a kind of cheat sheet for tic tack toe competitors.


## Below is info from the create react app bootstrap:

Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
